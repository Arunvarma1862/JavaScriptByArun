// JavaScript on the server refers to the execution of JavaScript code on the server-side of a web application. Traditionally, JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting within web browsers to enhance the interactivity of web pages. However, with the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now be executed on the server as well.

// Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side, outside of the browser. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that powers the Google Chrome browser. Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side development, allowing developers to build scalable, high-performance, and real-time applications.

// Some key aspects of using JavaScript on the server with Node.js include:

// Unified Language: Developers can use the same programming language (JavaScript) for both the client-side and server-side components of a web application. This can lead to improved code reusability and maintainability.

// Non-blocking I/O: Node.js is designed to handle a large number of simultaneous connections efficiently by using non-blocking I/O operations. This makes it well-suited for building applications that require high concurrency and responsiveness.

// Rich Ecosystem: Node.js has a vast ecosystem of modules and packages available through npm (Node Package Manager). This allows developers to easily integrate third-party libraries and tools into their server-side applications.

// Event-Driven Architecture: Node.js uses an event-driven, asynchronous model, which is well-suited for handling real-time applications and events
